# 1.Competitive Analysis

##　1.1 Self-organizing lists

List L of n elements
•The operation ACCESS(x) costs rankL(x) =distance of x from the head of L.
•L can be reordered by transposing adjacent elements at a cost of 1

## 1.2 On-line and off-line problems
**Definition.** A sequence S of operations is provided one at a time. For each operation, an
**on-line** algorithm A must execute the operation immediately without any knowledge of future operations (e.g., **Tetris**).An **off-line** algorithm may see the whole sequence S in advance
**Goal**: Minimize the total cost C_A(S).

## 1.3 Worst-case analysis of selforganizing lists
An adversary always accesses the tail (n th) element of L. Then, for any on-line algorithm A, we have C_A(S) = Ω(|S|⋅ n) in the worst case

## 1.5 The move-to-front heuristic
**Practice**: Implementers discovered that the move-to-front (MTF) heuristic empirically
yields good results.
**IDEA**: After accessing x, move x to the head of L using transposes:**cost** = 2 ⋅ rank_L(x)
The MTF heuristic responds well to locality in the access sequence S

## 1.7 MTF is O(1)-competitive

## 1.8 Potential function
![](https://github.com/MengYGuo/MengYGuo.github.io/blob/master/img/算法导论image/class14-6.png?raw=true)

> NOTE:
• Φ(Li) ≥ 0 for i = 0, 1, …,
• Φ(L0) = 0 if MTF and OPT start with the same list.
How much does Φ change from 1 transpose?
• A transpose creates/destroys 1 inversion.
• ∆Φ = ±2 

## 1.9 What happens on an access?

> We have r = |A| + |B| + 1 and r* = |A| + |C| + 1.

When MTF moves x to the front, it creates |A| inversions and destroys |B| inversions. Each transpose by OPT creates ≤ 1 inversion. 
Thus,

we have

Φ(Li) – Φ(Li–1) ≤ 2(|A| – |B| + ti) 

## 1.10 Amortized cost

## 1.11 The grand finale
![](https://github.com/MengYGuo/MengYGuo.github.io/blob/master/img/算法导论image/class14-9.png?raw=true)

## 1.12 Addendum

If we count transpositions that move x toward the front as “free” (models splicing x in and out of L in constant time), then MTF is 2-competitive.

What if L0 ≠ L0* ?

• Then, Φ(L0) might be Θ(n2) in the worst case.
• Thus, CMTF(S) ≤ 4 ⋅ COPT(S) + Θ(n2)

which is still 4-competitive, since n2 is constant as |S| → ∞.
